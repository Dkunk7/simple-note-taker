  ## Installation
  Running `npm i` in the main directory will install the necessary tools. In addition to `Express`, the app also uses `uuid` to generate unique IDs for each note.
  
  ## Usage
  Run `npm start` to host the app locally or visit <a href = "https://cryptic-river-33376.herokuapp.com/" target = "_blank">this page</a>, where it's currently hosted.

  ## Contribution
  As of right now, notes cannot be deleted from the app. I have plans to add that functionality, but I don't yet know how to handle delete requests. Assistance with this important piece of functionality would be welcome.
